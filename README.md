# Word Guess Game

## Description

My first Javascript project is an exercise to make a word guess game in a hangman style.  A key press starts the game and a random word from an array is chosen.  All words in my game follow a zoo animal theme.  As letters are guessed, each guess is either matched with an answer letter, or subtracts from the guesses left.

If the guesses run out, a loss is recorded and the game restarts.  If all of the answer letters are matched, a win is recorded and the game restarts.

## Made with

Javascript, HTML, & CSS

I used Bootstrap for the basic setup of the page.
